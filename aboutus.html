          We are students through DeltaV201. Our project idea was called Word
          Race and its a knowledge game based on knowing the longest and most
          common 1000 words in the English language.

                My name is Jean McMahon. I have moved back to Iowa after working
                several years on the East Coast as a personal or executive
                assistant to CEOs and presidents of nonprofits and fortune 500
                companies as well as high level of government officials. I am
                looking for a change in career and, since learning new
                technology has always been particularly enjoyable, I decided to
                try my hand at coding.

                Hello! My name is Nathan Hall! I am an Iowan born and raised. I
                left college part way through my second year to work full time
                at my current job as a warehouse manager. Being a manager gave
                me some needed insight to how certain team efforts are best
                made. Although I was enjoying my postion it wasnt what I wanted
                to do for the rest of my life. I decided to make the steps
                needed to put myself into the career path I enjoyed the most,
                web and software development. That decision led me here, to
                Delta V, where we have made vast strides towards that end. I am
                very happy with my decision to move towards a career I want to
                be a part of.

                Hi! My name is Lilly McBride and before I started studying
                software development I was a delivery driver. So I'm very
                familiar with working under pressure and using what information
                I have to fill in blanks. I decided to start learning how to
                code mainly because I enjoy solving puzzles. I want to work for
                a company whose ethics I admire and who I can count on to help
                me grow as a developer. I chose web development specifically
                because of its versatility and range of applications.

              Hi! My name is Collin Zeets! Before I came to DeltaV I was prior
              military. I'm familiar with structure and efficency. I decided to
              start learning how to code mainly due to my love for computers and
              wanting to make a job out of a hobby of mine.

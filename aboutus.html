                My name is Jean McMahon. Having grown up in a very large farm family, teamwork is my middle name.
                <br>
                I have moved back to Iowa after working several years on the East Coast as a personal or executive assistant to CEOs, presidents of nonprofits and Fortune 500 companies as well as high level government officials. 
                <br>
                I am looking for a change in career and, since learning new technology has always been particularly enjoyable, I decided to try my hand at coding with an eye towards UX/UI design.

                Hello! My name is Nathan Hall! I am an Iowan born and raised. 
                <br>
                I left college part way through my second year to work full time at my current job as a warehouse manager. Being a manager gave
                me some needed insight to how certain team efforts are best made. 
                <br>
                Although I was enjoying my postion, it wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I decided to take the steps needed to put myself on the career path I enjoyed the most,
                web and software development. 
                <br>
                That decision led me to Delta V, where we have made vast strides towards that end. I am
                very happy with my decision to move towards a career of my choosing.

                Hi! My name is Lilly McBride and before I started studying
                software development I was a delivery driver. So I'm very
                familiar with working under pressure and using what information
                I have to fill in blanks. I decided to start learning how to
                code mainly because I enjoy solving puzzles. I want to work for
                a company whose ethics I admire and who I can count on to help
                me grow as a developer. I chose web development specifically
                because of its versatility and range of applications.

              Hi! My name is Collin Zeets! 
              <br>
              Prior to DeltaV I served in the military. I'm familiar with structure and efficency. 
              <br>
              I decided to start learning how to code mainly due to my love for computers and wanting to make a job out of a hobby of mine.

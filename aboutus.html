                  I have moved back to Iowa after working several years on the East Coast as a personal or executive assistant to CEOs, presidents of nonprofits and Fortune 500 companies as well as high level government officials.

                  I am looking for a change in career and, since learning new technology has always been particularly enjoyable, I decided to try my hand at coding with an eye towards UX/UI design.

                    Hello! My name is Nathan Hall! I am an Iowan born and raised. 
                    <br>
                    I left college part way through my second year to work full time at my current job as a warehouse manager. Being a manager has given me some needed insight to how certain team efforts are best made. 
                    <br>
                    Although I enjoy my postion, it isn't what I want to do for the rest of my life. I decided to take the steps needed to put myself on the career path I enjoyed the most, web and software development. That decision led me to Delta V, where we have made vast strides towards that end. I am very happy with my decision to move towards a career of my choosing.

                    Hi! My name is Lilly McBride. Before I started studying
                    software development I was a delivery driver, so I'm very
                    familiar with working under pressure and using what information
                    I have to fill in blanks. <br>I decided to start learning how to
                    code mainly because I enjoy solving puzzles. I want to work for
                    a company whose ethics I admire and who I can count on to help
                    me grow as a developer. I chose web development specifically
                    because of its versatility and range of applications.

                  I decided to start learning how to code mainly due to my love for computers and wanting to make a job out of a hobby of mine.
